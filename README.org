[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU/Emacs]] [[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] backend for exporting files to WikiText format, to be used in [[http://tiddlywiki.com/][TiddlyWiki]].

This is a derived backend which uses =ox-html= as a base to export the file to a tiddler. As probably I use only a small subset of the wholeness of org-mode markup, this backend is most likely to be rather incomplete; anything not covered here is exported as html code, which is enough for most purposes.

Of course, if think this is not enough for you, feel free to open an issue and/or send a pull request; any feedback is always welcome! =)

** Requirements
This was tested on GNU Emacs =24.5.1= and Org mode =8.3.4=.

* Demo
** Text formatting
You can make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =code= and ~verbatim~, and, if you must, +strike-through+.

You can also try some "extreme" cases:
- /*bold italic*/
- */italic bold/*
- _*bold underline*_
- *_underlined bold_*

You can also add an horizontal rule:

* Math

Math is supported by [[https://www.mathjax.org/][MathJax]], through the [[https://github.com/kpe/tw5-mathjax-plugin][tw5-mathjax-plugin]].

When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
\begin{equation}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
\end{equation}
